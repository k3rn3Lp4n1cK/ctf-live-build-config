In order to white-list a domain, please add the desired domain to the bypass area in toolbar popup. For example, to white-list - www.foobar.com - please add - *foobar.com - to the filed. Please note that all the entries should be comma separated. Once you filled the bypass area, please mark the related checkbox as well (the checkbox next to the Bypass category).\n\nIn order to set PAC proxy, please add a PAC url to the designated area (PATH input area). Please note that a PAC path should have a certain format. For example if your PAC file is located in - C:// - folder (on windows machine), please write - file:///C:/pac.data - in the PATH area. If you do not know how to write a PAC file, please read this (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config) Wikipedia page.

You can easily set custom \"user-agent\" strings from the toolbar popup\n2. The extension uses a two-factor technique to mimic your default \"user-agent\" string, which is the most reliable method\n3. The extension does not use any resources when it is not spoofing the user-agent\n4. The extension enables user-agent spoofing on specific domains only; it is conversely possible to exclude certain domains from spoofing. Check the Options page for more info.\n5. You can set per-site user-agent strings\n6. There is an option to randomize user-agent strings.\n7. It is possible to set user-agent string for a single window; you can have a separate user-agent string for each browser window\n\nSupported operating systems:\nWindows, Mac OS, Linux, Chromium OS, Ubuntu, Debian, Android, iOS, AmigaOS, OpenBSD, BeOS, Haiku, Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Slackware, SUSE, gentoo, Fedora, Gentoo, Mageia, CentOS, Mint, DragonFly, Kubuntu, Mandriva, Zenwalk, Unix, GNU, OS/2, AIX, QNX, BEOS, RISC OS, Symbian, Nintendo, OpenSolaris, Kubuntu\n\nSupported browsers:\nInternet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, WebKit, Avant, Maxthon, Arora, Mozilla, Epiphany, Camino, Chimera, Chromium, Dragon, conkeror, Conkeror, Dillo, Links, Firebird, Swiftfox, Netscape, Flock, iCab, Iceape, icecat, IceCat, IceWeasel, Iron, Meleon, Konqueror, Lunascape, Lynx, MAXTHON, midori, Midori, KHTML, Mosaic, NetSurf, OmniWeb, Tablet, Mini, Phoenix, RockMelt, Safari, Browser, SeaMonkey, Slim, Webkit, w3m\n\nFor more info and general bug reports please use:\nhttps://add0n.com/useragent-switcher.html\n\nFor technical bug reports please use:\nhttps://github.com/ray-lothian/UserAgent-Switcher/","weeklyDownloads":6406,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Ray","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13129494/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/188/188200.png?modified=1622132777","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/188/188200.jpg?modified=1622132777","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/202/202435.png?modified=1622132779","width":440,"height":280,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/202/202435.jpg?modified=1622132779","thumbnailWidth":440,"thumbnailHeight":280}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/addondonation/10usd?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.3157,"reviewCount":181,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher/reviews/","updateDate":1671837708000},{"id":"uBlock0@raymondhill.net","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/607/607454-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/607/607454-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/607/607454-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"uBlock Origin","version":"1.46.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4047353/ublock_origin-1.46.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin","supportURL":"https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/","description":"Finally, an efficient wide-spectrum content blocker.
